When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    A remote repository is useful if you will be collaborating with other people. It is
    also a good way to keep a backup of your files in the cloud :-)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	So that you have more control over when you want to incorporate the changes into the
	local code base.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

	Fork is a feature of GitHub. You can use it to create a clone of someone else's
	repository on GitHub when you do not have permissions on the original owner's
	repository. A clone is a copy of a repository. It can be either local or remote.
	Branches are created within a repository when you want to experiment with a new
	feature without impacting anyone. You can merge a branch into another branch once
	done.
