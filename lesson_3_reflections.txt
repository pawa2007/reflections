When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    A remote repository is useful if you will be collaborating with other people. It is
    also a good way to keep a backup of your files in the cloud :-)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	So that you have more control over when you want to incorporate the changes into the
	local code base.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

	Fork is a feature of GitHub. You can use it to create a clone of someone else's
	repository on GitHub when you do not have permissions on the original owner's
	repository. A clone is a copy of a repository. It can be either local or remote.
	Branches are created within a repository when you want to experiment with a new
	feature without impacting anyone. You can merge a branch into another branch once
	done.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	It allows you to work without being connected to the network.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what 
would be harder?

	Collaborating without using GitHub would be harder since the communications would
	need to be via email, phone or instant messaging. GitHub integrates the communication
	process into the development process and makes it much easier by providing context-
	sensitive communication. The feature to review the code changes online and merge the
	pull request is pretty cool. However, it needs to be emphasized that the person(s)
	responsible for the master need to build a regression test suite to ensure that the
	pull request does not break existing functionality.
